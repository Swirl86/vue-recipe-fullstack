# TasteHub / Recipe App

A web-based application that allows users to search for recipes, view details, and save favorites.  
The project is built with **Vue + Vite + Tailwind CSS** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express + MongoDB** on the backend, using **[TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)** for real recipe data.

The main purpose of this project is to **learn and improve my fullstack development skills**, particularly with **Vue, Tailwind CSS, and backend integration**.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Backend tests are implemented using Jest and Supertest.

**Tests cover:**
- Searching recipes (recipes.test.js)
- Fetching recipe details by ID
- Handling unknown search queries
- CRUD operations for favorites (favorites.test.js)
- Fetching filter options dynamically (`filters.test.js`)

Tests run against a separate test database (recipe-app-test) to avoid affecting production data.

**Run tests with:**
```npm run test```
